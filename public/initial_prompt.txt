I’m thinking of creating a web app that helps users get a sense of chat patterns with their friends. When dating, people are especially anxious, and texting has ruined the art of mystery and intrigue that is essential to  the early stages of wooing someone. So my app lowk makes it worse and pokes fun at all this by giving the user a dashboard of statistics of chat trends, patterns based on user’s chat history with another person.

Essentially, user A will upload chat history shared with User B. The dashboard statistics will share engagement - who is more likely to start a chat, how quickly does the user B respond, who shares more media types, who sends longer texts, who shares more frequent texts, and the most important question in modern dating, are you going to be ghosted just based of text patterns not the content itself. It is just a mockery of modern dating, not a real legit website with any value.
